-- directly below it. Keep your work; you'll submit this file.
-- =========================================================

-- Q1) List all products (show product name and price), sorted by price descending.
SELECT name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Q2) Show all customers who live in the city of 'Lihue'.
SELECT *
FROM customers 
WHERE city = 'Lihue';

-- Q3) Return the first 5 orders by earliest order_datetime (order_id, order_datetime).
SELECT order_id, order_datetime
FROM orders
ORDER BY order_datetime ASC
LIMIT 5;

-- Q4) Find all products with the word 'Latte' in the name.
SELECT *
FROM products 
WHERE name LIKE '%Latte%';

-- Q5) Show distinct payment methods used in the dataset.
SELECT DISTINCT payment_method
FROM orders;

-- Q6) For each store, list its name and city/state (one row per store).
SELECT name, city, state
FROM stores;

-- Q7) From orders, show order_id, status, and a computed column total_items
--     that counts how many items are in each order. ***Notes: "computed column total_items" doesn't exist, must create. 
SELECT 
	o.order_id, 	-- o alias comes from "orders", this needed to be created
	o.status, 
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_items -- oi = computed from order_items, o = originates from orders
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi
	ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY o.order_id, o.status
ORDER BY o.order_id;


-- Q8) Show orders placed on '2025-09-04' (any time that day).
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_datetime >= '2025-09-04'
	AND order_datetime < '2025-09-05';

-- Q9) Return the top 3 most expensive products (price, name).
SELECT price, name
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- Q10) Show customer full names as a single column 'customer_name'
--      in the format "Last, First".
SELECT CONCAT(last_name, ', ', first_name) AS customer_name
FROM customers
ORDER BY last_name, first_name;
